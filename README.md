# AMG Match
AMG Match in a testing grounds for solving symmetric positive definite
systems using various Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) methods. The primary
coarsening approach for relaxation will be using the graph modularity
of the system for pairwise matching. This project is a joint research
effort of Panayot Vassilevski and myself to explore the applications
and properties of the modularity matrix and functional.

## Plan
[ ] Compute hierarchical aggregation to form coarse problem
[ ] Generate test matrices from PDEs in finite element analysis
[ ] Construct composite iterative solvers and test performance on test matrices
