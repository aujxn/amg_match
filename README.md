# AMG Match

AMG Match is research project for studying adaptive multigrid methods for
solving large and sparse positive definite matrix systems. A few different
smoothers and preconditioners are available and a couple iterative methods
are implemented. 

This is a work in progress and needs tons of work but if anyone needs a 
sparse iterative solver to go on top of `nalgebra-sparse` this may be
of use.

## Features

[x] Stationary solver
[x] Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient
[x] mu-cycle AMG solver / preconditioner
[x] L1 and Gauss-Seidel smoothers
[x] Triangular solvers (for Gauss-Seidel)
