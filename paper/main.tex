\section{Introduction}
This library implements some tools to explore techniques of adaptive AMG.
In classical AMG, the performance of the solver depends on the construction
of the relaxation and coarse-grid correction process (cite M. BREZINA).
Convergence of the method slows when the residual approaches the rhs of the
system (the iterate is in the `near null space` of the system).
This happens when the current iterate is an approximation of a minimal
eigenvalue of the matrix. Using this near null component and utilizing graph
modularity, we can construct a new relaxation and coarse-grid correction.
This provides the adaptivity when convergence suffers. Combining multiple of
these adaptive relaxation steps can provide a composite adaptive multigrid method.

\section{Library Details}
The library is broken into 3 main modules: partitioner, preconditioner, and solver.

\subsection{Partitioner module}
Here is implemented an algorithm described in (quiring 2019) which is graph pairwise
matching algorithm that only merges vertices where the change in modularity is
positive. The only requirement for this algorithm is that the matrix has positive
row sums. To convert our system to have positive rowsums, we construct a new system
with a matching sparsity pattern using a `near null` component. The modularity
matching algorithm applied to this new system then gives a hierarchy of interpolation
matrices that can be applied the the original system to create the coarse problem.

\subsection{Preconditioner module}
This module is called preconditioner but maybe a better name could be smoothers or
methods. In this module there are functions that take a system and provide the inverse
action of some method than can be used in an iterative solver. Currently, one can build 
L1 smoother, symmetric/forward/backward Gauss-Seidel, multilevel L1, and multilevel
Gauss-Seidel. All of these can be used as methods for the stationary solver but only
the symmetric methods can be used as a preconditioner in the conjugate gradient method.

\subsection{Solver module}
This module implements different iterative solvers that accept linear systems, a
method to base the solver on, and some parameters for the solver. Currently, only
the classical stationary iterative method and preconditioned conjugate gradient is
implemented. Soon I will be adding an adaptive solver to this module.

\section{Example Usage}
The library is currently packaged with a CLI binary that can show how the library
can be used to test different solvers on your systems.

\section{Goals}
Classical AMG often breaks down on highly anisotropic problems often found in finite
element methods. To address this failure, sometimes specific knowledge of the system
can be used to carefully construct a preconidtioner. The goal of this research is to
test some adaptive methods that don't require any knowledge about the system and
measure the computational complexity and memory demands of these methods on systems
where classical AMG performs poorly.
